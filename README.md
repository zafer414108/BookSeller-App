# Component Naming:

The component names (BookScreen, CardScreen, ShoppingCart) follow the PascalCase convention, which is good. Ensure that these components are correctly implemented and located at the specified paths.
# Navigation Options:

You are using the headerRight option in the Books screen to render the ShoppingCart component. Make sure that ShoppingCart is designed to work well as a header component.
# Unused Styles:

If you're not using styles, you can remove the const styles = StyleSheet.create({}) block to keep your code clean.
# Provider Placement:

Placing the Provider component at the root of your component hierarchy (as you have done) is the correct approach for using Redux. 
Overall, your code seems well-organized and adheres to React Native and React Navigation patterns. Make sure your Redux store, as well as the BookScreen, CardScreen, and ShoppingCart components, are correctly implemented and functional.
